Hello, this is my submission for Week 10 of Codepath.
This assignment focuses on setting up a honeypot and seeing the responses it collects.

## Which Honeypot did I deploy
I used the standard Dionaea honeypot used within the walkthrough

## Any issues you encountered
When I was initially setting up the virutal machines I accidentally ran the Admin VM in debug mode. I was not able to find any easy fix to resolve this issue so I had to restart my work up to that point.

## Summary of data collected:
My honeypot quickly recieved thousands of attacks within the first few hours of being set up. The attacks are international in scope, with the protocols ranging from mssqld, Blackhole, pcap and ftpd.

## Additional Questions:

From the MHN Server, I'm unsure how I can view malware samples specifically.
Other than that, it's been enlightening.
